##### The Impact of Temperature and Precipitation on Annual Crop Yield of Maize, Soy and Wheat in North America

This GitHub repository contains the data of the project: The Impact of Temperature and Precipitation on Annual Crop
Yield in North America

Project by: Maxim Mahnkopf, Nick van Nuland, Dominic Schierbaum



### script

The code had to be split into part 1 to 4 because some calculations were made in python and others in R. 

While part 1:3 contains preporcessing steps, part 4 contains the data analysis.



--> code_merged.html contains the whole code (part1, part2, part3, part4) <--



### data

The data folder contains the used crop yield raw data from GDHY, that can be downloaded from their paper: https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.909132

All other data files are part of the preprocessing in script 1 to 3

The data was accessed last: 29.08.2023
